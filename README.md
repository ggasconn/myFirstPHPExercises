# myFirstPHPExercises

# Explanation
Just some exercises I've doing this year at class. I push them to this repo to keep them stored in another place and more organized.

# Usage
If for some reason you've stumbled across this and you want to try any of them:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggasconn/myFirstPHPExercises
```
Keep in mind you will have to run the PHP files in a web server, such as Apache2 or Nginx, otherwhise you will not be able to get a proper execution of the program. There are also some editors that can run PHP code.
